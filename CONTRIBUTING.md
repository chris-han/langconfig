### PR Requirements

- Documentation should be updated if needed
- Commits should be atomic and well-described

## Style Guidelines

### Python (Backend)

- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use docstrings for functions and classes

```python
def process_workflow(
    workflow_id: str,
    config: WorkflowConfig,
    timeout: int = 300
) -> WorkflowResult:
    """
    Process a workflow execution.

    Args:
        workflow_id: Unique identifier for the workflow
        config: Workflow configuration object
        timeout: Maximum execution time in seconds

    Returns:
        WorkflowResult containing execution output and metrics
    """
    ...
```

### TypeScript (Frontend)

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use descriptive variable names
- Export types/interfaces

```typescript
interface WorkflowNodeProps {
  id: string;
  data: NodeData;
  onUpdate: (id: string, data: Partial<NodeData>) => void;
}

export const WorkflowNode: React.FC<WorkflowNodeProps> = ({
  id,
  data,
  onUpdate
}) => {
  // ...
};
```

### Git Commits

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Keep first line under 72 characters
- Reference issues when applicable: `Fix #123`
